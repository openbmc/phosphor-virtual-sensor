      "message": "Hi Patrick,\nThank you for reviewing it.\nI did submit a PR to ExprTk to fix this issue, but the maintainer closed it. His reasoning was based on C++\u0027s \u0027zero-overhead principle\u0027—adding a NaN check to inrange would impose a cost on all users, including those who can guarantee their inputs are never NaN. Therefore, I decided to handle it here.",
