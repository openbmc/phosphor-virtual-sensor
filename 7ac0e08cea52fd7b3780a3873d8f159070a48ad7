      "message": "Thanks Patrick\n\nThere are two things to clarify here:\n1. This service is installed under /usr/bin by default, we have reached a consensus\n2. We use copyfile instead of configure_file, which is what I am doing recently, but copyfile does not support configuration, so I am more inclined to delete @bin@.",

No... you\u0027ve decided to make some simplifications when there is no configuration done to switch from configure_file to copyfile.  This is fine, but only when there _isn\u0027t_ configuration being done.  The whole point of configure_file is to be able to configure files.\n\nAgain, I don\u0027t really see a benefit to removing the prefix support, unless you want to make a project-wide proposal that we do not support prefix installs in `.service` files.  We shouldn\u0027t be making these changes solely based on what assorted maintainers accept because then we end up with inconsistency across the project.\n\nIf you think we shouldn\u0027t use `@bin@` in any service files (for simplicity reasons), please write a TOF proposal so we can get it documented.",
