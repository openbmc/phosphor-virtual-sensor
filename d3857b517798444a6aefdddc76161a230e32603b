The Redfish event is really suppose to indicate some kind of repair action that should be done on the system, but a phosphor-virtual-sensor does not point to any specific hardware repair action that needs to take place.  If there is a real hardware sensor failure, the underlying dbus-sensor would/should have already reported this event.",
