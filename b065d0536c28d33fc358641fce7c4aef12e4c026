      "message": "Yes, it is related to the service dependency.\n\nBefore this change, we tried:\n1. Add \"After\u003dxxx.service\" to make sure phosphor-virtual-sensor runs after the dependent service, it does not work because the dependent object is not created when the service starts, it is created after a while (e.g. a sensor is created after EM probes the i2c buses). We get the crash intermittently.\n2. Add \"After\u003dmapper-waitxxx\" to make sure phosphor-virtual-sensor runs after the dependent DBus objects appears.\nThis way works, but it has problems:\n* When we add a new virtual sensor, the \"After\u003d\" will have to add the new dependent dbus objects;\n* Due to the fact that the dbus objects are created quite late after probing the i2c buses, the phosphor-virtual-sensor will be started very late, and thus the BMC_READY state is very late.\nThis results in HW CI failure because it checkes the BMC_READY time.\n\nThis patch resolves the above issues, that phosphor-virtual-sensor does not need to add dependency to any service, it just starts, try to get the service, and retry if it fails to get it.",

      "message": "You misunderstand me.  This shouldn\u0027t be the result of the service providing the sensor not loaded yet, because mapper returns ResourceNotFound.  Mapper doesn\u0027t return the ServiceUnknown error you put in the commit message.\n\nThe only way, I think, we can get the ServiceUnknown error is if *mapper itself* isn\u0027t loaded yet.  _This_ is a service file issue, isn\u0027t it?  But, I see `Wants/After\u003dobmc-mapper.target` already, so I don\u0027t know what is going on.\n\nI understand \"catching all exceptions and ignoring them\" solves the problem you\u0027re seeing, but to be honest, that is really heavy handed.  I\u0027d like some more information on where the ServiceUnknown error is coming from.\n\nI suspect there might be some issues with the mapper service file itself.  Is `xyz.openbmc_project.ObjectMapper.service` missing a WantedBy\u003dobmc-mapper.target?  It looks like right now it just has a \u0027Before\u0027 but that means there is no dependency to ensure it has fully started (including the BusName being registered) before obmc-mapper.target is started.",
